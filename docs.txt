# Measurement App - Code Documentation

## Overview

The Measurement App is a Python-based tool for object detection, grid overlay, area selection, and measurement calculation on images. The code is organized into a single script, `app.py`, which utilizes Streamlit for creating the web interface, OpenCV for image processing tasks, and FPDF for generating PDF reports.

## Functions and Classes

1. `load_yolo_model()`: Loads the YOLOv8 model for object detection.

2. `detect_objects(image, model)`: Performs object detection on the uploaded image using the YOLOv8 model.

3. `save_as_pdf(output_dict)`: Generates a PDF report with measurement details.

4. `draw_grid(image, step_size)`: Draws grids on the image with a specified step size.

5. `main()`: Main function to create the Streamlit web interface, handle user interactions, and display measurement results.

## Workflow

1. **Object Detection**: The script first loads the YOLOv8 model and performs object detection on the uploaded image.

2. **Grid Drawing**: Users can choose to overlay grids on the image with a customizable step size.

3. **Area Selection**: Users can select specific areas on the image using the drawable canvas provided by Streamlit.

4. **Measurement Calculation**: Measurements for both detected objects and selected areas are calculated based on pixel dimensions and a known reference scale.

5. **PDF Report Generation**: Measurement details are compiled into a PDF report, which includes object detection results and selected area measurements.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Users upload an image via the Streamlit interface.

2. **Object Detection**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes, and measurement details are displayed.

3. **Grid Drawing**: Users can overlay grids on the image to aid in measurement.

4. **Area Selection**: Users select specific areas on the image for detailed measurement using the drawable canvas.

5. **PDF Report**: The tool generates a PDF report containing measurement details for detected objects and selected areas.
